# Worst UI/UX App - UX Hell 😈

## 🎯 Objective
This web app is intentionally designed with **the worst UI/UX possible** while still being functional.

## 🔥 Features
- **Flashing Background** 🎆 (colors change every 0.3s)
- **Moving Button** 🏃 (runs away when hovered)
- **Fake Form Submission Errors** 🚫 (always fails)
- **Impossible CAPTCHA** 🔢 (numbers change randomly)
- **Message Resets Automatically** 😠 (after 3 characters)
- **Random Cursor Movements** 🎯 (annoying scrolling)
- **Random Alerts Every 7s** 🚨 (frustrating popups)
- **Random Sound Effects** 🔊 (plays at random)
- **Form Resets After 5 Seconds** ⏳ (if not submitted)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **HTML** (For structure)
- **CSS** (For chaotic styling)
- **JavaScript** (For the frustrating behavior)

## 🎮 How to Use
1. **Download** the `index.html` file.
2. **Open it in a browser** (Chrome recommended).
3. **Try to use it... and suffer!** 😈🔥

## 📜 License
This project is **open-source**, but you probably don't want to use it in real life. 😅
